# MIPS Assembly Learning Exercises

These projects were completed to learn assembly language and hardware-software interaction. A MIPS compiler is required to run this code. It was originally written using MARS http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/

##Basic Functions

Contains several functions used to learn how ASM works with registers including addition subtraction, and value comparison. 

##Introduction

Simple register handling and procedure calls.

##Loops

Several functions to:

- Return the index of the first element of an array that is equal to a value. Of said value doesn't exist, `-1` is returned, instead. 
- Return the largest value in an array

##NCR

This project was used to learn recrusion and system calls in ASM. A user is prompted for `n` which must be >= 0 and `k` which must be between `0` and `n`.  N choose K is then calculated with the values. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient
